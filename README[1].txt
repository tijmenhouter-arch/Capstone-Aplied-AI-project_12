TITLE OF THE DATASET:
Data from: 'Unveiling Climate-Adaptive World Heritage Management Strategies: the Netherlands as a Case Study'

DESCRIPTION OF THE RESEARCH:
This dataset includes data from the research article 'Unveiling Climate-Adaptive World Heritage Management Strategies: the Netherlands as Case Study', submitted to and accepted by the MDPI Sustainability journal. The article falls under the topic of 'World Heritage Sites and Values in Danger: Climate-Change Related Challenges and Transformation'. 

The dataset comprises three sets of textual data obtained from the UNESCO World Heritage Convention website for the Netherlands. These include the Statement of Outstanding Universal Value (SOUV), Management Plan (MP), and State of Conservation (SoC) Reports by the State Parties. The codes and reference texts from each document set were used for qualitative clustering analysis and categorised into sub-themes and themes. The occurrence frequency of finalised codes and sub-themes was counted to support the visualisation of their numerical patterns. The resulting visualisations, a Sankey diagram and two semantic networks, facilitated unveiling two climate-adaptive World Heritage management strategies.

DATA SPECIFIC INFORMATION:
There are four subfolders in this dataset folder: 
1) 'MP dataset': This subfolder contains three Excel files. The dataset was used to generate a network.
	- Edges_MP: Spreadsheet containing weighted connections from source to target nodes.
	- Nodes_MP: Spreadsheet with registered individual nodes, with their ID and names. They are classified under themes and types.
	- MP_dataset: The workbook consists of multiple spreadsheets. The 'Code_structure' sheet outlines the code structure, describing sub-themes, their abbreviations, and the themes they belong to. For the 'COUNT' sheet, please note that it contains the formula COUNTIFS that calculate occurrence frequencies of codes from each document. These values are only visible when editing is enabled. If the file is opened in read-only mode or protected view, the formula results may not be displayed. Other separate spreadsheets each represent a single World Heritage property, containing associated codes and reference texts extracted from its Management Plan.

2) 'Published figures': This subfolder contains the final visualizations and figures used in the paper, including a Sankey diagram for the SOUV dataset, two semantic networks for the MP and SoC Reports by State Parties datasets, and three distinct code structures for the SOUV, MP, and SoC Reports by State Parties datasets.
	- MP dataset codes
	- MP network
	- SoC Reports by State Parties codes
	- SoC Reports by State Parties network
	- SOUV dataset codes
	- SOUV Sankey diagram

3) 'SoC Reports dataset': This subfolder contains three Excel files. The dataset was used to generate a network.
	- 'Edges_SoC Reports': Spreadsheet containing weighted connections from source to target nodes.
	- 'Nodes_SoC Reports': Spreadsheet with registered individual nodes, with their ID and names. They are classified under themes and types.
	- 'SoC Reports datasets': The workbook consists of multiple spreadsheets. The 'Code_structure' sheet outlines the code structure, describing sub-themes, their abbreviations, and the themes they belong to. For the 'COUNT' sheet, please note that it contains the formula COUNTIFS that calculate occurrence frequencies of codes from each document. These values are only visible when editing is enabled. If the file is opened in read-only mode or protected view, the formula results may not be displayed. Other separate spreadsheets each represent a single World Heritage property, containing associated codes and reference texts extracted from its SoC Report.

4) 'SOUV dataset': This subfolder contains one Excel file. The dataset was used to generate a Sankey diagram. 
	- 'SOUV dataset': Coded texts from the SOUVs of 12 WH properties, each organised in separate spreadsheets. It also includes a separate spreadsheet detailing the code structure of the SOUV dataset. The 'Sankey_dataset' sheet outlines calculated occurrence frequencies of codes, sub-themes, and themes, serving as the basis for generating the SOUV Sankey diagram. For this sheet, please note that it contains the formulas COUNTIF and SUM to calculate occurrence frequencies of codes from each SOUV document. These values are only visible when editing is enabled. If the file is opened in read-only mode or protected view, the formula results may not be displayed. Please enable editing to access the calculated data.
